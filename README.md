## Instructions
* The purpose of the KAND Weather App is to help a user find the weather in their home city or a city they plan to visit. It also has the Air Quality Index listed so they can decide whether they feel comfortable going outside for a walk, hike, etc... Or whether it would be better to stay in side and drink Margaritas...
* The home page defaults to Denver, Colorado. From there the user can either click on a link for a more detailed 24 hour view of the weather, or select a different State and City to get the information for that destination.
* The selected City appears on a new page with the 7 day weather, and AQI.
* The user can also select a more detailed 24 hour forecast.
* The user can go back to the home page by clicking the "HOME" button.
