## Instructions
* The purpose of the **Kand Weather App** is to help a user find the weather in their home city or a city they plan to visit. It also has the Air Quality Index, (AQI), listed so they can decide whether they feel comfortable going outside for a walk, hike, etc... Or whether it would be better to stay inside.
* The home page defaults to Denver, Colorado. From there the user can either click on a link for a more detailed hourly breakdown of the weather, or select a different State and City to get the information for that destination.
* The newly selected City appears on a new page with the 7 day weather view and AQI information.
* The user can also select the more detailed 24 hour forecast for that City if they wish.
* The user can go back to the home page by clicking the "HOME" button.

## Setup Instructions
To run the application on a local machine:

* Clone down repository

* Run npm install
* Run npm start
* Webpage will open in separate browser

## Technologies Used:
* Github
* Context API
* React
* HTML5
* CSS
* Cypress
* Router
* Heroku Deployment
* Github Pages

## Learning Goals and Project Reflections
### Learning Goals
* Self teach and understanding of React Context API
* Practice using hooks
* Strengthen group dynamics
* Create local server using express
* Deploy local back-end and React App

### Wins
* Good team effort, very harmonious
* Fundamental understanding of Context API and basic hooks

### Challenges
* Self teaching a new technology while also trying to develop a better understanding of React
* Balance between time for other essential activities, (sleep, ideabox, etc..) and the desire to build a quality application

## Future Additions
* Fire Risk Display
* More in depth weather data - projected pressure, dew point, etc...
